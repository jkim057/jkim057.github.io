# Portfolio 2.0


# Notes and considerations:
## 2.0 Notes:
1. Rebuilt website from HTML5up "highlights" template.
* Was growing too dissatisfied with portfolio. With all the issues with hosting, decided to make a fresh start.
* Attempted to use netlify, after all the issues, will probably skip for time being, will use other host site.

2. Need to setup custom domain name.
### 1.0 Notes:
1. Took way too long to remember how Route and Link worked. Wish I figured it out sooner, it's so much more easy to figure out then the display:none and passing of the state nonsense I was overcomplicated things with.
2. Updated links to open new tabs instead of opening the links on same tab.
3. Updated to change favicon icon to initals (so it's not just base react icon)
4. ~~Trying to figure out if I can just import files or if I should just start with the template from the getgo~~
5. Decided to use template for website display, should make things easier to read.

6. Hosting issue: figure out how to setup netlify and remove heroku

7. Added resume to website, removing footer until I get everything settled.
* Footer needs correction, but need to leave credits.

8. Favicon works apparently, not sure how. Last time I checked, it didn't.
# Future plans:

## 2.0 Short Term:
1. ~~Setup Favicon icon~~
* It just works now apparently.
2. Setup Custom domain name
3. Clean up and make more presentable.
* fix footer template changes
* ~~I tried messing around with the CSS to fix the color of the footer, but now I'm wondering what I'm missing.~~
* ~~Still can not figure out why I can't change footer display~~
* Footer items did not exist in the classes I was editing, adding an class pushed the changes through.
4. Change background image to something else? maybe something teal blue 
## 2.0 Long Term:






### 1.0 Short term (OLD):
1. ~~Plan is to change about page to homepage.~~
~~Need to:~~
* ~~Change about tab from last position to front position.~~
* ~~Change about tab name to home page.~~
* ~~Welcome info needs to be located only on homepage~~
* ~~contact information needs to be moved to bottom of page.~~
* ~~Should contact info be available on every page or just home page?~~
2. ~~Set up bottom tag to list contact links~~
3. ~~The spacing and layout feels off. The title on each page + how the information gets laid out doesn't feel good.~~
### 1.0 Long term (OLD):
1. Change website template to look more clean.
2. Rebuilt website from HTML5up "highlights" template.
3. Need to setup the favicon icon.
